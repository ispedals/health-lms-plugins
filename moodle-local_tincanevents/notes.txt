DB structure
-------------
grades (keeps track of final course grades)
user id
course id
pretest score
posttest score
datetime

enrollment (keeps track of users that have courses in progress)
uid
user id
course id

pretest (keeps track of pretest scores before course completion)
foreign key enrollment_uid
attempt id
score maybe null
update datetime

posttest (keeps track of posttest scores before course completion)
foreign key enrollment_uid
score maybe null
update datetime

Events
-------
The events listened for are:

    Pretest started- add course attempt to enrollment table; add quiz attempt to pretest table
    Pretest completed - update pretest table
    Posttest started - add quiz attempt to posttest table
    Posttest completed - update posttest table
    Course completion - add to grades table, delete associated records in enrollment table
If we are having users unenroll and potentially reenroll, it should not be a problem.

UI
---
We are going to (tentatively) use https://docs.moodle.org/28/en/Configurable_reports for the UI.
