#report_tincan

A Moodle plugin that stores pretest and posttest scores on course completion.
This ensures that learner information will not be lost upon the learner unenrolling from a course.

For this to work:
* the course must have completion tracking enabled
* the course has a quiz with the name ending with the word `Pretest` (the capitalization does not matter)
* the course has a quiz with the name ending with the word `Posttest` (the capitalization does not matter)
